# Emma monorepo
This is a fork of [brunolemos/react-native-web-monorepo](https://github.com/brunolemos/react-native-web-monorepo)
- Add React router
- Add a microservice 
- Add asynchronous injection of the mini-app router from the microservice

## Why I choose React Router?
My teammates in my former company and current company love it.

## Why I choose Monorepo?
I need code management in microservice approach.
I need rampant code reuse.

## Why I choose react-native-web?
I see the future of ReactJS is limited. React native is the framework allowing cross-platform coding.
react-native-web is the most mature project, comparing with ReactXP etc
